# Node.js and NPM

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that allows developers to easily install and manage
third-party packages (also known as modules or libraries) that extend the functionality of their applications.
