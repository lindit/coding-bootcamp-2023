/**
 * Exercise: Variables & Operators
 * Create two variable or constants, a and b, that should store the values 5 and 3 respectively. Thereafter, also add a third variable or constant, sum, that stores the sum of a and b.
 * Log the sum to the console.
 */

// EXAMPLE:
const a = 5;
const b = 3;
const sum = a + b;
console.log(sum);

//TODO: Do the same as above for difference, product and quotient each.
// but define new variables for each of them.
// HINT: Use the operators -, * and / for difference, product and quotient respectively.
